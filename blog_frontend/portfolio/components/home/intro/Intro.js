				I am a University graduate and developing web systems in the last 7
				years. My first programming language was C and throughout my career I
				have learned various programming languages including but not limited to
				JavaScript, GoLang, and PHP. I’ve worked on some open source tools as
				Git and Docker. I started my professional career at the beginning of
				2013 as PHP developer. My main weapon was PHP, along with JavaScript,
				HTML, CSS. At the time jQuery was mostly used to develop interactive web
				pages. I moved to Dubai in December 2014, with an opportunity in hands
				with a startup (Awok.com), during my tenure till February 2020 I’ve
				learned Node and React. As I’ve never stopped learning, during recent
				pandemic after getting free from full time job I planned to learn
				statically-typed programming language and came across GoLang, and now I
				am maintaining arsenal of JavaScript and Golang.
