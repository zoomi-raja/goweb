				I am a university graduate and for me as a Web Developer it's been a 7
				year long journey. My first programming language was C and throughout my
				career i have learned various programming languages( JavaScript, Golang,
				PHP ) and open source tools ( Git, Docker ). Started myprofessional
				career by the start of 2013 as PHP, my main weapon along with it learnet
				JavaScript by then JQuery was mainly used to make web pages
				interactive.In Dec 2014 I got opportunity in one of the startup company
				(awok.com) in Dubai, UAE. Worked for them until feb 2020 and through
				this tenure learned Node and React. After getting free from a full time
				job, I thought of going back to statically-typed type programming
				language and came across golang. So now i would like to maintain arsenal
				of JavaScript and Golang.
